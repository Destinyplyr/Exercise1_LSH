# Exercise1_LSH 

This project was made for the University class "Software Development for Algorithmic Problems".
The task was to apply LSH with different distance metrics and compare the final results. 

# What I Learned

* LSH algorithm theory and implementation
* Different distance measures
* Git features
* Program organization & design
